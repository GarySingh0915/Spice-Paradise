			<h2>Advice</h2>
			<p>Instead of neglecting the entire food group, carbs, or low- carb, you can go for their moderate consumption.
			The complex carbohydrates that are found in whole grains are in fact, beneficial for the body.
			So, in place of refined grain and its products include whole grains. Moreover, carbs are found to be required for the complete breaking down of fat.
			In fact, for people who exercise, carbs are absorbed by the muscles that keep the body active.

			<h1>The Keto Diet: Good or Bad?</h1>
			<p>You must have heard of the Keto diet fad by now. A Keto diet plan is a popular type of low carb diet. It basically focuses on restricting the carb intake so that the body enters 
			a phase called “Ketosis”. It is a natural phenomenon that puts the body into a survival mode due to the low intake of carbs.</p>
			<p>Usually, the most readily available energy source in our body comes from Glucose, which is produced in the body when you eat carbohydrate-rich foods.</p>
			<p>Once you limit these high carb foods, the body turns to other energy sources like fat that are otherwise stored form.</p>
			<p>That is how the fat in the body is broken down into ketone bodies and used to release energy. While the keto diet can bring quick results in weight loss, it isn’t an ideal healthy diet.</p>

		<h1>Indian Diet Plan for Weight Loss</h1>
		<p>Indian Diet plans for weight loss can be overwhelming and curating one, can definitely be exhausting. This involves a lot of research and is quite time consuming. Hardly anyone wants to go through the struggle of finding a right diet.
		<p>When on a ‘diet’, a number of us look out for recipes that are not native and taste like nothing and also something raw. But what if we tell you this can be done differently? You can eat foods that are wholesome, delicious and also native?</p>
		<p>Indian foods are linked to excess amounts of rice (carbohydrates). This gives an impression that Indian foods are unhealthy.</p>
		<p>But the truth is, we have simply forgotten our staple foods and become too dependent on rice. Adding to this, we have started consuming all kinds of junk food.</p>
