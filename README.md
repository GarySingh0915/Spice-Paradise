# Spice-Paradise

This website is not for monetization purposes and is solely created for a college web design course. The content(text and images) was acquired from other food websites and is not 
original, but almost all of the code is purely made by me and no one else. There is mainly HTML and CSS code used to create this website with a tiny bit of Javascript used to 
create the slideshow animation for the home page(index.html). This website called "Spice Paradise" is loaded mainly with Indian street food recipes.
