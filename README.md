# Spice-Paradise

This website is not for monetization purposes and is solely created for a college web design course. The content(text and images) was acquired from other food websites and is not 
original, but almost all of the code is purely co-founded by me. There is mainly HTML and CSS used to create this with a tiny bit of Javascript used to 
create the slideshow animation for the home page(index.html). This website called "Spice Paradise" is loaded mainly with Indian street food recipes.
